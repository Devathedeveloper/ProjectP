1.1.4 Prototyping Your App
Prototyping adds interactivity to your wireframes, simulating the user experience.

Steps to Create a Prototype in Figma:

Linking Screens:

In Prototype mode, select an element (like a button) on your wireframe.
Drag the blue arrow to the screen you want to navigate to.
Set the interaction (e.g., "On Tap" ➔ "Navigate To" ➔ Target Screen).
Defining Interactions:

Set up transitions (e.g., slide, dissolve) to mimic real app behavior.
Ensure all navigational elements are linked (e.g., Back buttons, Tabs).
Testing the Prototype:

Use Figma's "Present" mode to interact with your prototype.
Navigate through the app as a user would to test the flow.
1.1.5 Tips for Effective Wireframing and Prototyping
Focus on Functionality: Prioritize the layout and navigation over aesthetic details.
Consistency is Key: Maintain consistent placement for navigation elements across screens.
Keep User Experience in Mind: Design with the user's ease of use as the primary goal.
Use Annotations: Add notes to explain functionality or interactions that aren't immediately obvious.
Iterate Based on Feedback: Share your wireframes and prototypes with others to gather insights and make improvements.

Scrolling: Vertical scroll for lists, horizontal scroll for categories.
1.1.8 Incorporating UX Best Practices
Accessibility:
Ensure text is legible with sufficient contrast.
Buttons and touch targets should be large enough to tap easily.

Provide visual feedback on button presses (e.g., color change).
Show loading indicators when fetching data.
